# Infrastructure - K8s cluster
I created a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster using Terraform, and I stored the code in a public GitHub repository. Although keeping infrastructure code in a public repository is not secure, this activity was done purely for demonstration purposes.

I also used GitHub Actions to run Terraform, which helps manage secrets in a more secure and automated way
